# Simon Game Mobile
The app has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the website lighting up one button in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

A game wherein players remember a sequence of patterns to win.
Created using HTML, CSS and Javacscript. An example project for learning jQuery
